I was looking for information on how to code a websocket server but all that I found 
was large and complex packages.
(Why do so many programmers try to solve all problems in the world in their own package?!)

What I was looking for was something that would just show me the concept in an easy way.

So here some code if you like me just like to get the basic concept.

The example is in php because it gives pretty easy and understandable code.
(I also made some python and java code that I will put here later if requested)

The stripped file "ws_auth-standalone_no_comments_and_trace.php" does this in only 
125-lines of code.
